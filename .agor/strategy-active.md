## Communication Guidelines

- All agents update this strategy file with progress
- Use agentconvo.md for coordination messages
- Create agent-specific memory files for detailed work tracking
- Generate comprehensive handoff snapshots between stages
- Coordinate through project-coordinator for quality assurance
