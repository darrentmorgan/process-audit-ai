- **DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md** (88 pages) - Developer environment setup, testing, debugging utilities

## Key Technical Findings Documented
- Multi-tenant architecture with 3 routing patterns (domain, subdomain, path)
- Complete RLS policy implementation for data isolation across 8+ tables
- Organization-scoped AI processing with plan-based limits and preferences
