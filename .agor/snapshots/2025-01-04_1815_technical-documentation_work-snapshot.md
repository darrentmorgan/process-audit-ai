## üéØ Task Assignment: Technical Documentation Creation

You are the **Technical Documentation Agent** in a 5-stage pipeline for completing Phase 5 of the ProcessAudit AI multi-tenant implementation. Your role is to create comprehensive technical documentation for the multi-tenant architecture.

## üìä Project Context

### Current Status
- **Branch**: `feature/clerk-multi-tenant` 
- **Phase**: 5 of 5 (Final Documentation & Deployment)
- **Previous Phases**: Architecture ‚úÖ, Core Implementation ‚úÖ, Distributed Integration ‚úÖ, Testing ‚úÖ
- **Your Stage**: Stage 1 of 5 in Pipeline Strategy

### Multi-Tenant Architecture Overview
ProcessAudit AI has been transformed from a single-tenant application to a comprehensive multi-tenant white-label SaaS platform with:

- **Authentication**: Clerk-based multi-tenant authentication with organization management
- **Data Isolation**: Organization-scoped RLS policies across all database tables
- **Distributed Architecture**: Main Next.js App + Cloudflare Workers backend
- **AI Integration**: Multi-provider AI routing (Claude, OpenAI) with organization-aware processing
- **Queue System**: Organization-scoped job tracking and automation generation
- **Testing**: Comprehensive multi-tenant test suite across all layers

## ‚úÖ Your Specific Responsibilities

Create comprehensive technical documentation covering:

### 1. Multi-Tenant API Documentation
- Document all organization-scoped API endpoints 
- Include authentication headers and organization context requirements
- Provide request/response examples with organization data
- Document error handling for organization access violations
- Cover rate limiting and organization-based quotas

### 2. Database Schema & Migration Documentation
- Document all database tables with organization relationships
- Detail RLS (Row Level Security) policies and their implementation
- Provide migration scripts and zero-downtime migration strategies
- Document data isolation patterns and verification procedures
- Include backup and restore procedures for multi-tenant data

### 3. Technical Integration Guides
- SSO integration guide with Clerk webhook handling
- Custom domain setup and SSL certificate management
- Organization-aware webhook implementations
- Third-party service integration patterns (maintaining organization context)
- Environment variable configuration for multi-tenant setup

### 4. Architecture & Security Documentation
- System architecture diagrams showing multi-tenant data flow
- Security implementation details and threat model
- Organization data isolation verification procedures
- Performance considerations and optimization strategies
- Scalability patterns for growing organization counts

## üìÅ Key Files to Reference

### Core Implementation Files
```
/pages/api/organizations/ - Organization management APIs
/middleware.js - Multi-tenant request routing and organization context
/lib/clerk-utils.js - Clerk integration utilities
/database/multitenant-schema.sql - Multi-tenant database schema
/contexts/OrganizationContext.js - Organization state management
```

### Workers Multi-Tenant Integration
```
/workers/src/database.js - Organization-scoped database operations
/workers/src/processor.js - Organization-aware job processing
/workers/tests/organization-multi-tenant.spec.js - Multi-tenant test examples
```

### Testing Examples
```
/__tests__/multitenant/ - Multi-tenant test suites
/test-organization-integration.js - Integration testing examples
```

## üéØ Deliverables Required

1. **API_DOCUMENTATION.md** - Complete API reference with multi-tenant examples
2. **DATABASE_SCHEMA_GUIDE.md** - Database structure and migration documentation  
3. **TECHNICAL_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md** - Step-by-step integration procedures
4. **ARCHITECTURE_SECURITY.md** - Architecture diagrams and security implementation
5. **DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md** - Developer environment setup for multi-tenant development

## üîÑ Success Criteria

- [ ] All organization-scoped API endpoints documented with examples
- [ ] Database schema changes fully documented with migration paths
- [ ] Integration guides provide actionable step-by-step procedures
- [ ] Security policies and RLS implementation clearly explained
- [ ] Architecture diagrams accurately represent multi-tenant data flow
- [ ] Documentation enables developers to understand and extend the system

## üß† Critical Context

### Multi-Tenant Key Concepts
- **Organization**: Top-level tenant container for all user data and settings
- **Organization Members**: Users associated with organizations with specific roles
- **RLS Policies**: Database-level security ensuring data isolation between organizations
- **Organization Context**: Request-scoped organization identification and authorization
- **Clerk Integration**: Authentication provider handling organization membership and SSO

### Environment Configuration
- Feature flagged with `ENABLE_CLERK_AUTH` for gradual rollout
- Requires Clerk webhook endpoints for organization event handling
- Database migrations need to be applied in correct order for RLS policies
- Workers need organization context passed through job processing

## üéØ Next Agent Instructions

After completing your documentation, create a comprehensive handoff snapshot for the **Deployment Automation Agent** (Stage 2) including:

- Summary of all technical documentation created
- Key technical requirements for deployment automation
- Database migration dependencies and sequencing
- Environment configuration requirements for production
- Any technical constraints or considerations for deployment

## üìù Working Branch

Create and work on branch: `docs/technical-integration`

```bash
git checkout -b docs/technical-integration
# Create your documentation
# Commit frequently with descriptive messages
```

## üöÄ Ready to Begin

You have full context of the multi-tenant implementation. Begin by:
1. Examining the key files listed above to understand the implementation
2. Creating the documentation structure in the `/docs/` directory
3. Working systematically through each deliverable
4. Testing your documentation against the actual implementation
5. Creating comprehensive handoff snapshot for next agent

**MANDATORY**: End your session with a comprehensive handoff snapshot in a single codeblock ready for the next agent.

*This is Stage 1 of 5 in the Pipeline Strategy. Focus on technical accuracy and completeness - the next agents depend on your documentation to build deployment and onboarding processes.*
