- **Cloudflare Workers (.dev.vars)**:
  - AI API keys for organization-aware processing
  - Supabase service key for organization-scoped database access
  - MCP server integration for n8n node documentation
  - Organization context passing for job processing

#### Database Requirements
- **Migration Sequence**: 3-phase zero-downtime migration strategy
  1. Schema addition (organizations, memberships, usage_logs tables)
  2. Existing table updates (organization_id columns + indexes)
  3. RLS policy activation (complete data isolation)
- **Performance**: 15+ indexes for multi-tenant query optimization
- **Security**: Comprehensive RLS policies across 8+ tables
- **Analytics**: Organization statistics views for usage tracking

#### Service Integration Requirements
- **Clerk Organization API**: Full organization management capability
- **Custom Domain Management**: DNS configuration + SSL provisioning
- **Webhook Infrastructure**: Bidirectional webhook system with verification
- **AI Model Routing**: Organization-aware processing with plan-based limits

## 🔧 Critical Technical Dependencies for Deployment

### 1. Service Account Requirements
```bash
# Clerk (Organization Features)
- Organization creation/management permissions
- Webhook endpoint configuration
- SSO integration capabilities (SAML/OAuth)

# Supabase (Service Role Access)
- Database schema modification permissions
- RLS policy management
- Service role for Workers database access

# Cloudflare Workers
- Workers deployment and management
- Custom domain routing capabilities
- Environment variable/secrets management

# DNS Management
- Domain/subdomain configuration authority
- SSL certificate provisioning access
```

### 2. Network Configuration Requirements
```bash
# Domain Routing Patterns
company.processaudit.ai → CNAME → your-app.vercel.app
custom-domain.com → CNAME/A record → Vercel edge
localhost:3000/org/company → Development testing

# API Endpoint Requirements
/api/organizations/* - Organization management
/api/automations/create - Organization-scoped processing
/api/webhooks/clerk - Organization event handling
/health - System health monitoring
```

### 3. Security Configuration Requirements
```bash
# Content Security Policy (Organization-aware)
- Base CSP for application security
- Organization-specific domain allowlisting
- SSL/TLS enforcement with HSTS

# Rate Limiting (Plan-based)
- Free: 100 requests/15min
- Professional: 2000 requests/15min
- Enterprise: 10000 requests/15min

# Data Isolation Validation
- RLS policy testing procedures
- Cross-organization access prevention
