# ProcessAudit AI - Staging Environment Setup

## 🚀 Landing Page & Access Control

We've created a beautiful landing page with waitlist functionality to gate access to the ProcessAudit AI tool.

## 🖥️ Local Development

The app is currently running on **http://localhost:3001**

### Access Methods:

1. **Landing Page (Default)**
   - Visit: `http://localhost:3001`
   - Shows the landing page with signup form
   - Collects emails for waitlist

2. **Direct App Access (Development)**
   - Visit: `http://localhost:3001/dev-access`
   - OR: `http://localhost:3001?access=granted`
   - Bypasses landing page and goes straight to the app

3. **Authenticated Access**
   - Sign up/sign in normally
   - Authenticated users can access the app directly

## 🗄️ Waitlist Database

```

### API Endpoint
- **POST** `/api/waitlist`
- Accepts: `{ email: "user@example.com" }`
- Validates email format

- Stores in Supabase

### Database Schema
- Table: `public.waitlist`
- Columns: id, email, source, created_at, updated_at, metadata
- RLS policies for security
- Indexes for performance

## 🔧 Access Control Logic

```javascript
// In pages/index.js
const hasAccess = router.query.access === 'granted' || user

if (hasAccess) {
  return <ProcessAuditApp />  // Show the tool
} else {
  return <LandingPage />      // Show landing page
}
```
