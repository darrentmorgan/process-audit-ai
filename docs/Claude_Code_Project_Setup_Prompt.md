   - Create a comprehensive project epic task using the template structure
   - Include actual GitHub repository URL from this project
   - Set realistic timeline based on codebase complexity
   - Add appropriate tags: ["epic", "active-project", "[detected-tech-stack]"]

2. **SPRINT TASKS** (in List ID: 901611068377 - Development Sprints):
   - Analyze current development status and create relevant sprint tasks
   - Break down remaining work into story-pointed tasks
   - Create tasks for any obvious missing features or improvements
   - Include GitHub integration with proper branch naming
   - Add tags: ["sprint", "development", "[component-type]"]

3. **BUG ANALYSIS** (in List ID: 901611068380 - Bug Reports):
   - Scan code for potential issues, TODOs, or FIXME comments
   - Create bug tasks for any identified issues
   - Include code location references and severity assessment
   - Add tags: ["bug", "analysis", "[severity-level]"]

4. **TECHNICAL DEBT ASSESSMENT** (in List ID: 901611068382 - Technical Debt):
   - Identify areas needing refactoring or improvement
   - Create tasks for code quality improvements
   - Include performance optimization opportunities
   - Add tags: ["technical-debt", "refactoring", "[component]"]

5. **DOCUMENTATION TASKS** (in List ID: 901611068384 - Documentation Tasks):
   - Analyze current documentation and identify gaps
   - Create tasks for missing README sections, API docs, etc.
   - Include code documentation improvements needed
   - Add tags: ["documentation", "missing-docs", "[doc-type]"]

6. **DEPLOYMENT & DEVOPS** (in List ID: 901611068385 - DevOps & Infrastructure):
   - Analyze current deployment setup and CI/CD pipeline
   - Create tasks for missing DevOps infrastructure
   - Include monitoring, testing, and deployment improvements
   - Add tags: ["devops", "infrastructure", "[environment]"]

## üîß TASK DETAILS TO INCLUDE:

### For Each Task Created:
- **Assignee**: darren@baliluxurystays.com
- **Realistic due dates** based on complexity
- **Story points** using Fibonacci scale (1,2,3,5,8,13)
- **Priority levels** based on importance
- **Detailed descriptions** with code references where applicable
- **GitHub repository link** in task description
- **ClickUp task ID integration** for commit referencing

### Task Naming Convention:
- Epic: "üéØ [Project Name]: [Main Goal]"
- Sprint: "üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Sprint [X]: [Sprint Goal]"
- Development: "‚ö° [Feature/Component]: [Description]"
- Bug: "üêõ Fix: [Issue Description]"
- Docs: "üìñ Documentation: [Doc Type]"
- DevOps: "‚öôÔ∏è Infrastructure: [Setup Type]"

## üîó GITHUB INTEGRATION SETUP:

1. **Analyze the current Git setup** and provide branch strategy recommendations
2. **Create GitHub integration tasks** for setting up proper workflow
3. **Include commit message conventions** with ClickUp task IDs
4. **Set up PR template recommendations** in a GitHub integration task

## üìä PROJECT ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:

Please analyze and include in your tasks:

1. **Codebase Assessment**:
   - Primary programming language(s)
   - Frameworks and libraries used
   - Database technology (if any)
   - Testing framework presence
   - CI/CD pipeline status

2. **Development Status**:
   - Current completion percentage estimate
   - Major features already implemented
   - Missing critical functionality
   - Code quality assessment

3. **Technical Stack Documentation**:
   - Dependencies and versions
   - Environment setup requirements
   - Build and deployment processes
   - Testing coverage status

## üéØ DELIVERABLES EXPECTED:

After analysis, create:
- 1 Project Epic task with complete project overview
- 3-5 Sprint tasks based on remaining work
- 2-4 Bug/issue tasks from code analysis
- 1-3 Technical debt tasks for improvements
- 2-3 Documentation tasks for missing docs
- 1-2 DevOps tasks for infrastructure needs

## üìà SUCCESS CRITERIA:

- All tasks should have realistic timelines
- Story points should reflect actual complexity
- GitHub repository properly linked
- Tasks should be actionable and specific
- Project structure should reflect actual codebase needs
- Integration with existing ClickUp workflow maintained

Please start by analyzing the codebase, then create all the ClickUp tasks with proper organization, realistic estimates, and comprehensive descriptions. Make sure each task includes the GitHub repository URL and follows the established ClickUp conventions.
