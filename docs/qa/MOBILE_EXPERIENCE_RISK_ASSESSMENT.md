Business Impact: Customer satisfaction, enterprise adoption
Technical Impact: Support burden, quality perception

Mitigation Strategy:
- Progressive enhancement approach with graceful degradation
- Mobile device testing matrix (iOS Safari, Android Chrome, older devices)
- Performance budgets for low-end devices
- Fallback UI patterns for unsupported features

Timeline: 2 weeks testing and optimization
Owner: Mobile QA validation team
```

#### **MR-002: Offline Sync Complexity**
```yaml
Risk Description: Offline-to-online synchronization may cause data conflicts or loss
Probability: MEDIUM (50%)
Impact: MEDIUM-HIGH (Data integrity, compliance audit trail)
Business Impact: Compliance failures, audit trail gaps
Technical Impact: Data corruption, sync conflicts

Mitigation Strategy:
- Simple last-write-wins conflict resolution for MVP
- Comprehensive audit logging for all offline activities
- Manual conflict resolution interface for complex cases
- Progressive sync enhancement with conflict detection

Timeline: 3 weeks sync architecture validation
Owner: Backend development team with QA validation
```

#### **MR-003: Battery and Performance Impact**
```yaml
Risk Description: Mobile app may drain battery or perform poorly on older devices
Probability: MEDIUM (40%)
Impact: MEDIUM (User adoption, field operation disruption)
Business Impact: Field staff resistance, productivity loss
Technical Impact: Performance optimization complexity

Mitigation Strategy:
- Performance monitoring and battery usage tracking
- Code splitting and lazy loading for resource optimization
- Background task management and efficient caching
- Device capability detection with adaptive UI

Timeline: 2 weeks performance optimization
Owner: Mobile development team
```

### **ðŸŸ¢ LOW RISK (Standard Monitoring)**

#### **LR-001: Camera Permission Management**
```yaml
Risk Description: Users may deny camera permissions affecting compliance documentation
Probability: LOW (30%)
Impact: LOW-MEDIUM (Compliance workflow interruption)
Business Impact: Manual compliance fallback required
Technical Impact: Graceful degradation complexity

Mitigation Strategy:
- Clear permission request messaging with business value explanation
- Alternative compliance documentation methods (text notes, manual upload)
- Progressive permission requests when features are needed
- Fallback workflows for permission-denied scenarios

Timeline: 1 week permission flow optimization
Owner: UX and mobile development
```

#### **LR-002: Browser Compatibility**
```yaml
Risk Description: Mobile web features may not work on older mobile browsers
Probability: LOW (25%)
Impact: LOW (Limited user base on older browsers)
Business Impact: Minimal - older browser users can use desktop
Technical Impact: Additional polyfills and fallback code

Mitigation Strategy:
- Progressive enhancement with feature detection
- Graceful degradation for unsupported features
- Clear browser requirement communication
- Desktop fallback for incompatible mobile browsers

Timeline: 1 week browser testing validation
Owner: QA testing team
```

#### **LR-003: Network Reliability in Field Environments**
```yaml
Risk Description: Poor network connectivity in field environments may affect sync
Probability: LOW (35%)
Impact: LOW (Offline functionality designed for this scenario)
Business Impact: Minimal - offline mode handles this case
Technical Impact: Robust offline handling already implemented

Mitigation Strategy:
- Robust offline-first architecture with local storage
- Background sync with exponential backoff retry
- Clear offline/online status indicators
- Manual sync triggers for user control

Timeline: Ongoing monitoring
Owner: Operational support team
```
