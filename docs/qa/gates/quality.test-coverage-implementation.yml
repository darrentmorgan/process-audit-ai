# Root Cause Analysis

  issue: "Jest JSX Configuration Failure"
  description: "Babel/TypeScript parser cannot handle JSX syntax in tests and coverage collection"
  evidence:

    - "Coverage collection failing on all React components"
    - "Test execution blocked for component-based tests"
    - "TypeScript parser interpreting JSX as generic type parameters"

# Technical Debt Assessment

    impact: "Blocks all JSX-based testing and coverage collection"
    effort_estimate: "2-3 days with React/JSX Babel expert"
    priority: P0
    business_risk: "Prevents enterprise-grade quality validation"

  test_architecture:
    severity: HIGH

# Coverage Analysis

# Risk Assessment
risks:
  critical:
    - "Cannot achieve enterprise quality standards"
    - "95% coverage target completely unachievable"
    - "Security validation through testing impossible"
    - "Compliance certification blocked"

  high:
    - "Customer confidence undermined by quality gaps"
    - "Enterprise sales blocked by quality concerns"
    - "Development velocity reduced by testing issues"

  medium:
    - "Technical debt accumulation in test infrastructure"
    - "Team productivity impacted by testing failures"

# Business Impact

# Recommendations
immediate_actions:
  - "HALT Story 4 execution until Jest JSX configuration resolved"
  - "Return to Story 1 with React/JSX Babel configuration expert"
  - "Add React JSX preset to babel.config.js"
  - "Update Jest transform configuration for JSX support"
  - "Validate JSX parsing in both test execution and coverage contexts"

follow_up_actions:
  - "Rewrite comprehensive test suites with corrected JSX support"
  - "Execute full test coverage analysis after configuration fix"
  - "Re-assess quality gate with functional test infrastructure"
  - "Complete enterprise readiness certification"

# Sprint Impact
sprint_impact:
  story_1_assessment: "INCOMPLETE - Missing JSX configuration"
  story_2_impact: "Configuration ready, deployment blocked by Docker"
  story_3_impact: "Security architecture ready, integration blocked by dependencies"
  story_4_impact: "CRITICAL FAILURE - Cannot proceed without Jest JSX fix"

  overall_sprint_health: CRITICAL
  sprint_goal_achievability: LOW
  recommended_action: "Sprint scope reduction and Jest configuration resolution"

# Quality Certification
certifications: []
blockers:
  - "Jest JSX configuration prevents all React component testing"
  - "Coverage collection blocked by JSX parsing errors"
  - "Comprehensive test suites unusable with current configuration"

# Compliance Status
compliance_readiness:
  soc2: NOT_READY
  gdpr: NOT_READY
  iso27001: NOT_READY
  reason: "Cannot validate through testing due to infrastructure failure"

# Final Decision
final_decision: FAIL
gate_status: BLOCKED
next_story_approved: false
escalation_required: true
escalation_reason: "Critical test infrastructure failure blocking quality objectives"

# Notes
notes: |
  Critical Jest configuration failure discovered during Story 4 execution.

  The Jest configuration resolved in Story 1 only addressed ES module imports but
  missed the fundamental JSX parsing requirement for React component testing.

  This represents a critical infrastructure failure that blocks:
  - All React component testing
  - Coverage collection across the entire codebase
  - Security boundary validation through testing
  - Enterprise quality standard achievement

  IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED: Comprehensive Jest JSX configuration resolution
  before any further quality validation work can proceed.

# Quality Assurance Decision
qa_decision: "ESCALATE TO DEVELOPMENT TEAM FOR JEST JSX CONFIGURATION RESOLUTION"
