Hospo Dojo is just as confident in the boardroom as 
we are in the kitchen. Just like the Defender, we are

BRAND 
ARCHETYPE
People have personalities, and so do brands. Brands are carefully 
constructed, strategic personalities. If you want to do good 
business by building a successful brand, you need to be skillful 
at matching your brand’s personality with your audience’s. 
Previously economists assumed a “rational man” who “maximises 
utility” with every purchase decision. We know better. Many of 
our purchase decisions are guided by optimizing pleasure, a need 
for belonging, a desire for confidence, or many other emotional 
drivers... We feel our ways into our purchases more than we think 
our way there, but what maps do we have for our feelings?
Psychology holds the key. Archetypal psychology takes us deeper 
into the dynamics of our feelings as they are really felt and 
experienced. The archetypes are symbolised by personalities 
like you and me, not abstract principles. They are recognisable. 
They are familiar. They speak to universal stories and journeys 
that all human beings share and can intuitively understand. 
Using Brand Archetypes saves you from enduring long, instructional 
monologues on how to calculate your brand messaging and 
allows you to enter a conversation-like game with your brand. 
Akin to improvisation in acting, they will allow you to be more 
intuitive. They’re a tool that will evoke good questions, vivid 
images, stimulate the imagination and allow you to reach 
deeper into understanding your brand and the relationship to 
your market using the right (imaginative) side of your brain.

ARCHETYPE
Like the Brand Archetype, using a Customer Archetype saves you 
from memorizing millions of demographic statistics and constantly 
referring to a thick deck of analytics when trying to compute how 
your brand messaging will be received. Archetypes allow you to 
enter a conversation-like game with your audience. It frees the 
marketing team up to be more intuitive. It’s a tool that will evoke good 
questions, vivid images, stimulate the imagination and allow you to 
reach deeper into understanding your brand and the relationship 
to your market using the right (imaginative) side of your brain.

HOW TO USE
ARCHETYPES
Archetypes
Using archetypes can help you get intentional about how you are presenting 
yourself. Do you understand how the content you post creates a perception 
of your values and who you are? Do you understand who you are talking 
to? Does what you intended align to what is understood by your audience? 
Even a light touch of your archetype into your communications on social 
media can help you present yourself more accurately and intentionally.Social Media
Archetypes can be used as a proxy for the motivations of your audience. 
Choose ones that best represent your segments. How do your brand and 
client archetypes relate to each other - what are their agreements and 
expectations of each other? This can be a surprising method to discover links 
between your organisation and understanding audience needs and wants.Target AudienceUse archetypes to empower your creatives and strategists 
to use their instincts to “gut check” developing campaigns, 
communications and products instead of getting caught in semantic 
differences or trying to micromanage brand manifestations.Strategy Shorthand
Before launching any new initiatives or communications use the 
brand or client archetype to evaluate - “Would X do or say this?”, 
and don’t forget to apply at all levels, in all departments from HR 
to C-Suite, Marketing and Finance to be really effective.Values AlignmentYour brand archetype represents your company’s personality 
and behaviour. Apply your archetype to internal communications, 
processes, events, goals and values to stay consistent with your 
internal culture. Consistency creates confidence, trust and strength 
inside your organisation that flows outwards in how it serves.Team Culture

LOGO EMBLEM GUIDE
If additional text is required for the 
Hospo Dojo Emblem Logos in the future, 
follow the procedure outlined below.
When the byline fits within 
the space provided: 
1. Using the Emblem Logo template, 
replace the placeholder text 
with the new desired text. 
2. Adjust the two dots vertically to 
sit equally between 'Hospo Dojo' 
and the new text. Adjust the two 
dots horizontally to sit equally 
between the two bounding circles.  
When the byline is longer than 
the space provided: 
1. Using the Emblem Logo template, 
replace the placeholder text 
with the new desired text. 
2. Shrink the point size of the font so 
that the space between the two dots 
and both lines of text are equal. 
3. Resize the textbox to ensure the 
new text sits equally between 
the two bounding circles. 'Certified' fits within the 
space provided; dots 
have been adjusted. 'Sensei' fits within the 
space provided; dots 
have been adjusted.  'Prep For Success' is longer 
than the space provided; text 
size has been made smaller. Visual Identity

DESIGN ELEMENTS
Leather Texture
The brown leather texture is used 
minimally for debossing the Hospo 
Dojo logo in order to create a tactile 
feel and add visual interest. 
In these instances, logo minimum 
spacing rules do not apply and a drop 
shadow effect can be used to depict 
a real and tangible design element. 
Main headlines in Gefika Regular can 
also be debossed on leather shapes/
patches using the supplied Leather 
Headline template. These should be 
used sparingly and reserved for titles 
only. Any applications of body copy 
on leather patches are in white. 
The leather shapes, leather texture, and 
the Hospo Dojo debossed logo working 
file are supplied as brand assets.Visual Identity

feeling of community and collaboration.
They are used for decorative purposes 
such as underlining key pieces of text, 
circling headings, or drawing attention 
to important objects or images.

DESIGN ELEMENTS
Split Backgrounds
Horizontal or vertical split backgrounds 
are commonly used in the Hospo Dojo 
visuals for distinctive brand recognition. 
These contrasting split backgrounds 
can be the Hospo Dojo Wave Pattern 
or a solid fill brand colour.   
Split backgrounds should be combined 
with either an image or text for an 
overlapping, layered effect. They should 
be placed on a page/application so 
that the center aligns with the 'split'.
