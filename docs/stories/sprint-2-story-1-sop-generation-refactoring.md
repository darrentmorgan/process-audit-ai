## Dev Notes

### Technical Context
- Current SOP generation uses Cloudflare Workers which limits multi-tenant customization
- Sprint 1 multi-tenant security framework provides foundation for secure SOP generation
- Database schema needs to support industry configuration and prompt template storage
- Backend API can leverage existing authentication and organization context validation

### Industry Types to Support
- **Restaurant**: Food safety, kitchen procedures, customer service protocols
- **Hospitality**: Guest services, housekeeping, front desk procedures, safety protocols
- **Medical**: Clinical procedures, patient safety, HIPAA compliance, sterilization protocols
- **Manufacturing**: Quality control, safety procedures, equipment maintenance
- **Retail**: Customer service, inventory management, point-of-sale procedures
- **Professional Services**: Client onboarding, project management, quality assurance

### Dependencies
- **Sprint 1 Security Framework**: Organization context validation and multi-tenant isolation
- **Database Access**: Supabase integration for industry configuration storage
- **AI Integration**: Claude/OpenAI for industry-specific SOP generation
- **Authentication**: Clerk integration for organization admin permissions

### Risk Factors
- **Medium Risk**: Migration complexity from Workers to backend affecting existing functionality
- **Medium Risk**: Database performance impact from additional industry configuration queries
- **Low Risk**: Industry prompt quality requiring iterative refinement
- **Low Risk**: User experience changes during migration transition

### White Label Considerations
- **Hospo-Dojo**: Hospitality-specific SOP generation with hotel/restaurant focus
- **Future Clients**: Industry-specific branding and terminology in SOPs
- **Compliance Requirements**: Industry-specific regulatory and safety standards
- **Custom Terminology**: Organization-specific language and procedure naming

## Testing

### Unit Tests Required
- [ ] Industry configuration CRUD operations
- [ ] SOP prompt template management
- [ ] Industry-specific prompt selection logic
- [ ] Multi-tenant isolation validation

### Integration Tests Required
- [ ] End-to-end SOP generation workflow with industry customization
- [ ] Organization context validation for SOP generation
- [ ] Industry configuration API endpoint testing
- [ ] Performance comparison between Workers and backend implementation

### Security Tests Required
- [ ] Cross-tenant isolation for industry configurations
- [ ] SOP prompt template access control validation
- [ ] Organization admin permission validation for industry settings
- [ ] Audit logging verification for SOP generation activities

### Acceptance Test Scenarios
```gherkin
Scenario: Industry-Specific SOP Generation
  Given an organization configured for "hospitality" industry
  When I generate an SOP for "front desk check-in procedure"
  Then the SOP should include hospitality-specific terminology
  And the SOP should reference hotel industry standards
  And the SOP should include guest service best practices

Scenario: Multi-Tenant Industry Isolation
  Given two organizations with different industry configurations
  When each organization generates SOPs
  Then each organization should only see their industry-specific prompts
  And no cross-tenant industry configuration should be accessible
  And audit logs should track SOP generation per organization

Scenario: Admin Industry Configuration
  Given an organization administrator wants to change industry type
  When they update the organization industry configuration
  Then the change should be validated and saved securely
  And subsequent SOP generation should use the new industry prompts
  And the change should be logged for audit compliance

Scenario: Backward Compatibility
  Given existing organizations without industry configuration
  When they generate SOPs
  Then they should receive a default general business prompt
  And be prompted to configure their industry type for better results
  And existing SOP generation functionality should remain intact
```
