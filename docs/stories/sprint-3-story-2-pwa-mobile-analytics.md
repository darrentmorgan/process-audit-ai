```gherkin
Scenario: PWA Installation and Usage
  Given a field operations worker wants app-like experience
  When they install ProcessAudit AI as PWA to their home screen
  Then they should get native app experience with offline functionality
  And they should receive push notifications for relevant SOPs and compliance alerts
  And the app should work reliably without browser UI

Scenario: Mobile Analytics for Supervisors
  Given a hotel supervisor wants to monitor housekeeping performance
  When they access the mobile analytics dashboard
  Then they should see real-time SOP completion rates by room type
  And they should see compliance photo documentation statistics
  And they should get industry benchmarks for hospitality performance

Scenario: Enhanced Offline Sync with Conflicts
  Given two staff members edit the same compliance report offline
  When both devices come back online simultaneously
  Then the system should detect the conflict and provide resolution options
  And no compliance data should be lost during conflict resolution
  And audit trail should capture both original edits

Scenario: Push Notifications for Compliance
  Given a restaurant organization with food safety requirements
  When health inspection procedures are updated
  Then all kitchen staff should receive push notifications about changes
  And notifications should include industry-specific compliance context
  And notification delivery should respect user preferences and organization settings
