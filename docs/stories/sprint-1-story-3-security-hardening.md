## Dev Notes

### Technical Context
- Current security implementation has gaps in multi-tenant isolation
- Authentication flows need comprehensive security boundary validation
- External integrations require webhook security and API key management
- Compliance requirements (GDPR, SOC2) need implementation for enterprise sales

### Dependencies
- **Clerk Authentication** system integration
- **Supabase Database** with RLS policy configuration
- **External API keys** for PagerDuty, Slack, AI providers
- **Audit logging infrastructure** with correlation ID support

### Risk Factors
- **High Risk**: Security vulnerabilities could lead to data breaches
- **Medium Risk**: Performance impact from additional security checks
- **Medium Risk**: Compliance gaps could block enterprise customer onboarding
- **Low Risk**: Integration complexity might affect development velocity

### Security Standards
- **Authentication**: Multi-factor considerations, session management
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control with organization context
- **Data Protection**: Encryption, anonymization, secure storage
- **Audit**: Comprehensive logging, correlation tracking, compliance reporting

## Testing

### Security Tests Required
- [ ] Cross-tenant data access prevention tests
- [ ] Privilege escalation prevention validation
- [ ] Authentication boundary security tests
- [ ] API endpoint security validation tests
- [ ] Webhook signature validation tests

### Penetration Tests Required
- [ ] Multi-tenant isolation boundary testing
- [ ] Authentication bypass attempt testing
- [ ] SQL injection prevention in tenant queries
- [ ] Cross-site scripting (XSS) prevention
- [ ] API abuse and rate limiting validation

### Compliance Tests Required
- [ ] GDPR data handling procedure tests
- [ ] Audit trail completeness and accuracy tests
- [ ] Data encryption validation tests
- [ ] Security incident response procedure tests

### Acceptance Test Scenarios
```gherkin
Scenario: Multi-Tenant Data Isolation
  Given two different organizations exist in the system
  When a user from organization A attempts to access organization B's data
  Then the access should be blocked at the database level
  And the attempt should be logged for security audit
  And no data from organization B should be returned

Scenario: Authentication Security Boundary
  Given a user has a valid JWT token for organization A
  When they attempt to switch to organization B without proper membership
  Then the organization switch should be rejected
  And the user should remain in organization A context
  And the attempt should be logged as a security event

Scenario: Webhook Security Validation
  Given a webhook is configured for PagerDuty integration
  When a webhook request is received without valid signature
  Then the webhook should be rejected
  And the invalid attempt should be logged
  And no alert processing should occur

Scenario: Emergency Tenant Suspension
  Given a security breach is detected for an organization
  When emergency tenant suspension is triggered
  Then all access to that organization's data should be immediately blocked
  And data should be preserved for investigation
  And audit logs should capture the suspension event
```
