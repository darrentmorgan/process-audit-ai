## Dev Notes

### Technical Context
- Existing monitoring foundation is solid but lacks advanced capabilities
- Need enterprise-grade observability for Fortune 500 customer requirements
- Current monitoring stack: Prometheus + Grafana + AlertManager (basic configuration)
- Enhancement adds: Jaeger, Loki, cAdvisor, Uptime Kuma, enhanced configurations

### Dependencies
- **Docker & Docker Compose** for container orchestration
- **Existing monitoring/docker-compose.yml** as foundation
- **Environment variables** for service configuration (Slack, PagerDuty keys)
- **Network access** for external service monitoring

### Risk Factors
- **Medium Risk**: Resource consumption increase with additional monitoring services
- **Low Risk**: Network connectivity issues affecting external monitoring
- **Low Risk**: Configuration complexity requiring documentation updates

## Testing

### Unit Tests Required
- [ ] Monitoring service health check validation
- [ ] Alert rule syntax and logic verification
- [ ] Dashboard configuration validation
- [ ] Service discovery endpoint testing

### Integration Tests Required
- [ ] End-to-end alert routing workflow testing
- [ ] Dashboard data source connectivity validation
- [ ] External service monitoring accuracy
- [ ] Performance impact assessment under load

### Acceptance Test Scenarios
```gherkin
Scenario: Enhanced Monitoring Stack Deployment
  Given the enhanced Docker Compose configuration is deployed
  When I check all monitoring service health endpoints
  Then all 13 services should report healthy status
  And resource usage should remain within acceptable limits

Scenario: Intelligent Alert Routing
  Given an alert is triggered by Prometheus
  When the alert matches security component criteria
  Then it should route to PagerDuty security service
  And notify #security-incidents Slack channel
  And include proper escalation context

Scenario: Business Intelligence Dashboard
  Given the enhanced executive dashboard is loaded
  When I view the real-time KPIs
  Then I should see uptime, response time, error rate, and AI cost
  And business intelligence panels should display conversion metrics
  And multi-tenant data should be properly isolated

Scenario: Distributed Tracing Integration
  Given Jaeger is configured and running
  When I make an API request that spans multiple services
  Then the complete request trace should be visible in Jaeger UI
  And performance bottlenecks should be identifiable
```
