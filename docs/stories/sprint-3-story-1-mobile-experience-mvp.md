### Acceptance Test Scenarios
```gherkin
Scenario: Mobile SOP Access for Field Operations
  Given a housekeeper is cleaning a hotel room without WiFi
  When they access the room cleaning SOP on their mobile device
  Then they should see step-by-step procedures with hospitality terminology
  And they should be able to mark each step complete with photo documentation
  And the completion data should sync when WiFi becomes available

Scenario: Industry-Specific Mobile Interface
  Given a restaurant organization with kitchen staff
  When staff access SOPs on mobile devices
  Then the interface should use food service terminology (guest, kitchen operations)
  And navigation should show food safety, kitchen operations, compliance categories
  And emergency procedures should be easily accessible

Scenario: Offline Compliance Documentation
  Given a healthcare worker performing patient care procedures
  When they complete compliance steps without internet connectivity
  Then they should be able to take photos and add digital signatures
  And all compliance data should be stored locally
  And data should automatically sync when connectivity returns

Scenario: Mobile Performance for Field Devices
  Given field staff using older mobile devices with slow networks
  When they access SOPs and compliance features
  Then the interface should load within 3 seconds
  And offline functionality should work reliably
  And battery usage should remain under 5% per hour
