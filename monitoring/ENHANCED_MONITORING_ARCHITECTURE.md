- Docker Swarm for Docker-native deployments
- File-based for static configurations
- HTTP endpoints for custom discovery
```

#### **2. Metric Collection Strategy**
```prometheus
# Specialized metric endpoints:
/api/metrics           # Core application metrics
/api/metrics/business  # Business intelligence metrics
/api/metrics/tenant    # Multi-tenant specific metrics
/api/metrics/ai        # AI provider performance metrics
/api/metrics/pdf       # PDF generation service metrics
```

### **Alert Routing Intelligence**

#### **1. Context-Aware Routing**
- **Component-based routing** (AI, Database, Security, Business)
- **Severity-based escalation** (Info → Warning → Critical)
- **Time-based escalation** with increasing urgency
- **Geographic routing** for distributed teams

#### **2. Smart Inhibition Rules**
- **Cascade prevention** (system down inhibits component alerts)
- **Duplicate suppression** (similar alerts grouped)
- **Maintenance mode** support with alert silencing
- **Correlation-based filtering** (related alerts combined)
