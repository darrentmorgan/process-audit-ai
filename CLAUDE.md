### PDF Generation Testing
```bash
# PDF Specific Test Suites
npm run test:pdf                # Run all PDF generation tests
npm run test:pdf:render         # Test PDF rendering quality
npm run test:pdf:performance    # Performance and load testing for PDF generation
npm run test:pdf:branding       # Validate multi-tenant branding templates
npm run test:pdf:security       # Check for PDF generation security vulnerabilities

# PDF Validation and Compliance
npm run pdf:validate:structure   # Validate PDF document structure
npm run pdf:validate:content     # Check content accuracy and completeness
npm run pdf:validate:metadata    # Verify PDF metadata and organizational branding
```

**PDF Test Coverage:**
- **Rendering Tests**: Validate precise document layout and styling
- **Performance Tests**: Measure PDF generation time and resource usage
- **Branding Validation**: Ensure multi-tenant branding is correctly applied
- **Security Scanning**: Check for potential vulnerabilities in PDF generation
- **Content Accuracy**: Compare generated PDFs against predefined templates
- **Compliance Checks**: Validate document standards and organizational requirements

**Test Scenarios:**
1. Generate audit report PDF
2. Generate executive summary PDF
3. Generate SOP document PDF
4. Test PDF generation with different branding configurations
5. Validate PDF generation under high concurrency
6. Performance testing with large documents
7. Security vulnerability scanning
