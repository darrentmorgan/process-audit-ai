### PDF Generation Testing
```bash
# PDF Specific Test Suites
npm run test:pdf                # Run all PDF generation tests
npm run test:pdf:render         # Test PDF rendering quality
npm run test:pdf:performance    # Performance and load testing for PDF generation
npm run test:pdf:branding       # Validate multi-tenant branding templates
npm run test:pdf:security       # Check for PDF generation security vulnerabilities

# PDF Validation and Compliance
npm run pdf:validate:structure   # Validate PDF document structure
npm run pdf:validate:content     # Check content accuracy and completeness
npm run pdf:validate:metadata    # Verify PDF metadata and organizational branding
```

**PDF Test Coverage:**
- **Rendering Tests**: Validate precise document layout and styling
- **Performance Tests**: Measure PDF generation time and resource usage
- **Branding Validation**: Ensure multi-tenant branding is correctly applied
- **Security Scanning**: Check for potential vulnerabilities in PDF generation
- **Content Accuracy**: Compare generated PDFs against predefined templates
- **Compliance Checks**: Validate document standards and organizational requirements

**Test Scenarios:**
1. Generate audit report PDF
2. Generate executive summary PDF
3. Generate SOP document PDF
4. Test PDF generation with different branding configurations
5. Validate PDF generation under high concurrency
6. Performance testing with large documents
7. Security vulnerability scanning

# UI Components

## Simplified User Interface
ProcessAudit AI uses a simplified, focused user interface design:

### Header Components
- **ProcessAuditApp Header**: Clean logo, tagline, and simple authentication buttons
- **UserMenu**: Simplified with Sign In/Sign Up buttons (organization selector removed for better UX)
- **Demo Mode Banner**: Clear indication when using demo access (?access=granted)

### Core Application Flow
1. **Landing Page**: Professional landing with demo access and authentication options
2. **Process Input**: File upload and text description interface
3. **AI Analysis**: Real-time progress tracking with Claude API integration
4. **SOP Discovery Questions**: Dynamic form generation based on process analysis
5. **Results Review**: Professional audit reports with automation recommendations
6. **PDF Export**: Enterprise-grade document generation (Audit Reports, Executive Summaries, SOPs)

### Removed for Simplicity
- **Organization Selector**: Removed from header for simplified user experience
- **Automation Generation**: Replaced with strategic platform recommendations
- **Complex Multi-tenant UI**: Simplified to focus on core process analysis

### Professional Document Generation
- **Puppeteer + HTML Templates**: Professional business document generation
- **Multi-page Layouts**: 300-600KB enterprise-grade PDFs
- **Three Document Types**: Complete reports, executive summaries, structured SOPs
- **Professional Formatting**: Headers, footers, branding, structured content

This simplified approach reduces cognitive load while maintaining all essential functionality and professional document output.

Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
